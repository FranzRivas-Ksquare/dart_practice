# Dart Practice
I made my own test for this home work. To test this code just need to run *dart tasks.dart*

## My test
**Test have variables for set inputs to functions**

**The test output was made to choose between word if is true or flase:**
`Task 4:\nYear ${yearTaskFour} ${isLeapYear(yearTaskFour) ? 'is' : 'is not'} leap year\n`
`Taks 6:\n${wordOne} and ${wordTwo} ${hasEqualChar(wordOne, wordTwo) ? 'have' : 'haven`t'} the same characters\n`
